# Frogger Game Clone

This is a simple Frogger Clone and is one of my first real javascript projects.

# Installation

  - Start by navigating to the [project repository][git-repo-url]
  - Click the green "Clone or Download" button and then download the files as a ZIP.
  - Extract the ZIP file to your desktop.  If you need an archiver, try [7-zip][7-zip] it's free!
  - Open the file you just extracted named "frogger-clone-master".
  - Double click on the file named index.
  - Enjoy!
